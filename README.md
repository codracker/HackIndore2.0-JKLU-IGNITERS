### Problem Statement 5:Build a POC of recommendation engine with AI.
We all love to have the customized contents in our feed.Take example of shopping site the type of product your search about,is more likely you see,the next time you come to the site.This is how the market earns as you tend to buy that product since you were already searching for it.
But how this is done? How your machine  gets to know your likes and priorities?This is what recommendation engine is.In simple term it is nothing but an automated form of a “shop counter guy”. You need to build a generalised smart recommendation engine i.e it should learn from its each successful selection by the user.

### Solution:
Recommendation Engine based on collaborative filtering with the objective to suggest users apparels and restaraunts based on their past order history and wishlists or cart items. We bring in a special feature for our users wherein the platform will recommend restaraunts in their cities based on the following parameters:
1. Their Apparel purchase bracket  
2. Type of Apparel purchased  
3. Cuisine preferred by the user.
4. Restaraunt Rating
